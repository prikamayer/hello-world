Just my repository to learn

--- Hello visitor! ---

I'm here just trying to figure it out what all this is about.
A curious person who nows nothig about programming but admires who understand this unhuman languages.

Besides I'm an entusiast of collaborative culture, so I'm atracted for lean more about open source and software communities, and of course how GitHub works.
